PROJECT TITLE: (Simple) Calculator

OVERVIEW: A calculator interface with addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division functions.
The user may input numbers by clicking on them.  

CONCEPTS: GUI, click listeners, for loops, if/else statements, string to double operation, orientation of GridLayout, JTextField, etc. 
I had to combine my knowledge of GUIs with loops and lists to make this calculator work. I accounted for user input using an 
action listener, both as a string and as a double. I researched how to change the orientation of GridLayout in order to format the
buttons the way I wanted, and how to clear ArrayLists. I also just had to use my brains to figure out stuff like how to perform 
multiple calculations in one step, deal with order of operations, and how to use the old result in a new calculation.

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Use the Main method in the Frame class.
